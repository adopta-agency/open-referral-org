			<h2>I am Kin Lane, the API Evangelist...</h2>
		</header>
		<p>This is my work in partnership with <a href="https://openreferral.org/">Open Referral</a> to move forward the <a href="https://openreferral.github.io/api-specification/definition/schema/">Human Services Data Specification (HSDS)</a>, in conjunction with a definition for the <a href="https://openreferral.github.io/api-specification/definition/">Human Services Data API (HSDA)</a>. I've dedicated a portion of my time as the API Evangelist to help move forward the conversation about how we store, share, publish, and collaborate around human services data.</p>
		<p>I began this work with Greg Bloom (<a href="https://twitter.com/greggish">@greggish</a>) of <a href="http://openreferral.org">Open Referral</a> back in 2015 and 2016, and signed on as the technical lead by 2017. I'm invested in the projects success, and will invest as much time as I possibly can helping contribute to the data schema, API definition, tooling, and storytelling. I feel the project reflects the API potential, helping make our world work better for humans, not just something that tech startups do.</p>

			<h2>What Is The Human Services Data Specification</h2>
		</header>
		<p>The vision of Open Referral is a world where everyone has access to — and the ability to effectively use — information about the resources that are available in their community.</p>
		<p>The <a href="https://openreferral.github.io/api-specification/definition/schema/">Human Service Data Specification (HSDS)</a> is a data schema used to describe human services that are present in any city, state, or province. The schema is to provide a common way to descibe information, helping standardize how it can be stored, and shared in service of the Open Referral vision.</p>
		<p>The <a href="https://openreferral.github.io/api-specification/definition/">Human Services Data API (HSDA)</a> is an OpenAPI definition providing the technical details of an API which can provide access to data stored in the HSDS format. An API will open up human service systems and websites for integration with other systems, web and mobile applications--helping ensure everyone has access to, and the ability to put human services to work.</p>

			<h2>Human Service Providers & Implementations</h2>
		</header>
		<p>This work is not about providing a single API. It is about developing a blueprint for deploying and managing many APIs. The schema and API definition is meant to provide a common blueprint that any government or human services organization can follow to design and deploy their own HSDS compliant API ensuring it will speak to any other HSDS compliant APIs--making human service websites and application potentially more interoperable.</p>
		<p>I'm supporting Open Referral's vision of "a world where everyone has access to — and the ability to effectively use — information about the resources that are available in their community." Embracing the open web, and acknowledging that humans and other systems and applications will benefit from a common data schema, as well as API definition, when it comes to individual human services implementations, as well as interoperability, aggregation, and federation of data across potentially thousands of individual implementations.</p>

			<h2>Vendors Serving The Community</h2>
		</header>
		<p>This work is not ignoring the fact that there are already numerous software providers already supporting a variety of human services data solutons in use across 211, and other municipal and health care systems. We are actively working with the top vendors to help gather their feedback, and expertise in operating real world human service implementations, and incorporate in future versions of the specification.</p>
		<p>We are currently taking the schema and API documentation from over five providers and including as part of the current schema and API release. We will be actively working with new providers as they approach Open Referral. Our goal is to work with as many of the leadings groups as we possibly can, and help ensure interoperability with all the major systems that are currently serving municpalities.</p>
		<p>For the Human Services Data Specification to be successful it will need to have the buy-in of major commercial providers, making it an industry standard in use across open source and proprietary human services implementations worldwide.</p>

			<h2>A Demo Portal and API</h2>
		</header>
		<p>An important part of moving the human services API specification forward for me was to have an actual working demo I could use to better understand what is possible from a technical perspective. Without a functional version of the API specification it is easy miss many of the finer details involved with deploying, managing, testing, monitoring, and generally operating an API in the real world.</p>
		<p>I have developed a prototype API in PHP, using the <a href="https://www.slimframework.com/">Slim API framework</a>, giving me a working API that I can change and keep in sync with each version of the API specification. <a href="https://github.com/adopta-agency/open-referral-api">The API prototype is available on Github</a>, but it is not production ready, so use at your own risk. If you are going to fork make sure and ping me, as I probably have a more recent version available that I have not updated because of time.</p>
		<p>I have also developed <a href="http://developer.open.referral.adopta.agency/">a working developer portal<a> where I have published the working API prototype. The API portal runs <a href="https://github.com/adopta-agency/open-referral-org-developer">100% on Github, using Github Pages as the host, and the site using Jekyll as it's CMS</a>. The portal is meant to be forked by any single API implementation, and converted into a custom portal. The portal intentionally uses Twitter Bootstrap, so that anyone can easily customize, while keeping things following a common standard. We will work on documenting the process when we have the time and resources.</p>

		<p>One area I study as the API Evangelist is around <a href="http://monetization.apievangelist.com/">the monetization</a>, and <a href="http://plans.apievangelist.com/">access plans of leading API providers</a>--studying how they are generating revenue around API consumption and even <a href="http://partners.apievangelist.com/">partnerships</a>. I'm looking to extend this work to the human services industry, helping providers generate much needed revenue from their hard work, while still serving their consistuents.

		<p>We have just released the alpha version for v1.1 of the Human Services Data API (HSDA) Sepcification. You can read all about this release on the Open Referral blog, but the primary objective of the release is about ensuring the API offers as much coverage of v1.1 of the HSDS schema as we can.

		<p>The Human Services Data and API Specifications are a community project. We need help defining the specification, as well as building tooling on top of the specification. There are endless projects that could be developed on the specification, but there are never enough people and resources to make them happen.</p>
		<p>You can get involved with the data schema specification within it's Github repository, and the API specification in it's Github repository. The rest of the conversation is occurring on the Open Referral Google Group and the Slack channel. You can also visit the Open Referral site to learn more, and reach out directly to Greg and the rest of the organization.</p>

			<h2>Some Final Thoughts</h2>
		</header>
		<p>Everytime I work on the Open Referral project I use this page as my start page. I will be updating it regularly as I have more information about the work that is going on. I will syndicate blog posts, and link up other Github repositories and projects as they become available--so return often, and feel free to bookmark this page.</p>
		<p>Open Referral is Greg's passion, something that is contagious, and help contribute to it becoming my passion. I can't think of a more important API to be working on in today's political climate. We need to be investing in our communities at the local level, and a human services API can help bring folks together, delivering a common approach to helping people find the human services they need to get through the day.</p>
		<p>Thanks for tuning in, and let me know how I can help get you plugged into what we are doing.</p>
