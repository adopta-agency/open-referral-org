			<h2>I am Kin Lane, the API Evangelist...</h2>
		</header>
		<p>This is my work in partnership with <a href="https://openreferral.org/">Open Referral</a> to move forward the <a href="https://openreferral.github.io/api-specification/definition/schema/">Human Services Data Specification (HSDS)</a>, in conjunction with a definition for the <a href="https://openreferral.github.io/api-specification/definition/">Human Services Data API (HSDA)</a>. I've dedicated a portion of my time as the API Evangelist to help move forward the conversation about how we store, share, publish, and collaborate around human services data.</p>
		<p>I began this work with Greg Bloom of Open Referral back in 2015 and 2016, and signed on as the technical lead by 2017. I'm invested in the projects success, and will invest as much time as I possibly can helping contribute to the data schema, API definition, tooling, an dstorytelling. I feel the project reflects the API potential, helping make our world work better for humans, not just something technical that startups do.</p>

			<h2>What Is The Human Services Data Specification</h2>
		</header>
		<p>The vision of Open Referral is a world where everyone has access to — and the ability to effectively use — information about the resources that are available in their community.</p>
		<p>The <a href="https://openreferral.github.io/api-specification/definition/schema/">Human Service Data Specification (HSDS)</a> is a data schema used to describe human services that are present in any city, state, or province. The schema is to provide a common way to descibe information, helping standardize how it can be stored, and shared in service of the Open Referral vision.</p>
		<p>The <a href="https://openreferral.github.io/api-specification/definition/">Human Services Data API (HSDA)</a> is an OpenAPI definition providing the technical details of an API which can provide access to data stored in the HSDS format. An API will open up human service systems and websites for integraiton with other systems, web and mobile applications--helping ensure everyone has access to, and the ability to put human services to work.</p>

			<h2>Human Service Providers / Implementations</h2>
		</header>
		<p>This work is not about providing a single API. It is about providing a blueprint for providing many APIs. The schema and API definition is meant to provide a common blueprint that any government or human services organization can follow to design and deploy their own HSDS complaint API ensuring it will speak to all the other HSDS compliant APIs--making human service websites and application interoperable.</p>
		<p>I'm supporting Open Referral's vision of "a world where everyone has access to — and the ability to effectively use — information about the resources that are available in their community." Embracing the open web, and acknowledging that humans and other systems and applications will benefit from a common data schema, as well as API definition, when it comes to individual human services implementations, as well as interoperability, aggregation, and federation of data across potentially thousands of individual implementations.</p>

			<h2>Vendors Serving The Community</h2>
		</header>
		<p>This work is not ignoring the fact that there are already numerous software providers already providing the humn services data solutons in use across 211, and other municipal and health care systems. We are actively working with the top vendors to help gather their feedback, and expertise in operating real world human service implementations, and incorporate in future versions of the specification.</p>
		<p>We are currently taking the schema and API documentation from over five providers and including as part of the current schema and API release. We will be actively working with new providers as they approach Open Referral. Our goal is to work with as many of the leadings providers as we can, and ensure interoperability with all the major systems that are currently serving municpalities.</p>
		<p>For the Human Services Data Specification to be successful it will need to have the buy-in of major commercial providers, making it an industry standard in use across human services implementations worldwide.</p>

		<h2>Focus On Platform Projects</h2>
		<p>Open Referral is platform agnostic. We are not invested in Human Service Data Specific (HDSS) compliant implementations running on any single platfrom, or vendor. Our mission is that every human services implementation can run anywhere, and these are the platforms we are currently targeting with implementations and projects.</p>

			<h2>Created a Demo Portal and API</h2>
		</header>
		<p>An important part of moving the human services API specification for me was to have an actual working demo I could use to better understand what is possible from a technical perspective. Without a functional version of the API specification it is easy miss many of the finer details involved with deploying, managing, testing, monitoring, and generally operating an API in the real world.</p>
		<p>I have developed a prototype API in PHP, using the Slim API framework, giving me a working API that I can change and keep in sync with each version of the API specification. The API prototype is available on Github. It is not production ready, so use at your own risk. If you are going to fork make sure and ping me, as I probably have a more recent version available that I have not updated because of time.</p>
		<p>I have also developed a working developer portal where I have published the working API prototype. The API portal runs 100% on Github, using Github Pages as the host, and the site using Jekyll as it's CMS. The portal is meant to eventually be forked by any single API implementation, and converted into a custom portal. The portal intentionally uses Twitter Bootstrap, so that anyone can easily customize, while keeping things following a common standard.</p>

<!-- Define Revenue Layer -->

		<h2>Define A Revenue Layer</h2>
		<p>One area I study as the API Evangelist is the monetization, and access plans of leading API providers--essentially how they are generating revenue around API consumption and partnerships. I'm looking to extend this work to the human services industry, helping providers generate much needed revenue from their hard work, while still serving their consistuents. Here is an aggregation of all my stories regarding monetization of public data, and how this applies to my Open Referral work.</p>

		<h2>Improve Schema & API Definition</h2>
		<p>We have just released the alpha version for v1.1 of the Human Services Data API (HSDA) Sepcification. You can read all about this release on the Open Referral blog, but the primary objective of the release is about ensuring the API offers as much coverage of v1.1 of the HSDS schema as we can.
